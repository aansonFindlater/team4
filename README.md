Note: To work smarter and create a more efficient user interface for CRU operations on customers and equipment while reusing code and establishing a common framework, you can follow a web development approach with a shared layout. Here's how you can structure it:

1. Shared Layout (Framework Page):
        Create a shared layout (e.g., in HTML or a web framework) that includes the menu and footer. This layout 	will serve as the foundation for all pages.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Include CSS and other common headers -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Menu -->
    <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/customers">Customers</a></li>
                <li><a href="/equipment">Equipment</a></li>
                <!-- Add more menu options as needed -->
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <!-- Page Content -->
    <main>
        <!-- Page-specific content will be inserted here -->
    </main>

    <!-- Footer -->
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content goes here -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Customer Entry and Edit Pages (CRU Operations):
        Create a separate page for customer entry (Add Customer) and customer edit (Edit Customer).
        These pages will utilize the shared layout and focus on customer-related form elements.

<!-- customer-entry.html -->
@extends('shared-layout')

@section('content')
    <h1>Add Customer</h1>
    <!-- Customer entry form goes here -->
@endsection

----------------------------------------------

<!-- customer-edit.html -->
@extends('shared-layout')

@section('content')
    <h1>Edit Customer</h1>
    <!-- Customer edit form goes here -->
@endsection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Equipment Entry and Edit Pages (CRU Operations):
        Similarly, create separate pages for equipment entry (Add Equipment) and equipment edit (Edit Equipment).
        These pages will also use the shared layout and focus on equipment-related form elements.

<!-- equipment-entry.html -->
@extends('shared-layout')

@section('content')
    <h1>Add Equipment</h1>
    <!-- Equipment entry form goes here -->
@endsection 

----------------------------------------------

<!-- equipment-edit.html -->
@extends('shared-layout')

@section('content')
    <h1>Edit Equipment</h1>
    <!-- Equipment edit form goes here -->
@endsection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Reusable Code:
        Implement reusable code components for form elements, validation, and any common functionality (e.g., form 	submission handling).
        Use AI or code generators to automate repetitive tasks, such as form field generation or validation.


Note: By following this approach, you establish a consistent layout with a shared menu and footer. Each member working on customer and equipment pages can reuse the common framework, reducing redundancy and promoting code reusability. This approach also allows for easier maintenance and scalability as new features or pages can be added with minimal effort while maintaining a cohesive user interface.
